#Bachelor Thesis Project




This project was made for my Bachelor thesis.

**Name**: 

**Description**:



The project simulates the creation of IoT devices. 
The devices send data to an api endpoint. The data that is gathered in json format
will be used by a main model and they will be preproccessed before the trainning.
An addition endpoint will store addition entries that can be used 
for model testing purposes.
